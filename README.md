# [The Hazeltine Library](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine) \[WIP\]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is, and always has been a data preservation project. Links to or backups of content in this repository does not inherently imply an endorsement of that content,** nor does it mean that the information is meaningful to me or my practice. 
> 
> **Update, May 2024:** These files will soon be reorganized and moved to the [libhazeltine/archives](https://github.com/libhazeltine/archives) repository, which will be made public when this happens. This in preparation for the next phase of the project, which is backing up and reformatting all the text in the URLs listed.

> I am aware of the fact that certain people from these communities do not want artifacts of their past being spread. If you participated in the public OEC and actively do not want your writings being stored, please file an [issue](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine/issues/new?title=Exclusion+request+for%3A&labels=exclusion) with any screen names that may have been attached to content you have created, and proof that it is yours.

*Phase 1*

A curated collection of content from psionics message boards from the Wayback Machine. Psionics is defined as the use of psychic abilities and energies in a context independent of wider spirituality.

Unlike formal parapsychology, psionics was practiced informally, by people who made money in other hobbies, and who shared information openly, without paywalls, on a somewhat-decentralized network of forums and blogs. 

While the communities of those forums, and the people who ran those blogs, are all gone, they, perhaps unknowingly, left quite a bit behind. This project seeks to organize and preserve those ruins, and build a core layer of documentation so that anyone who wants to can start where they left off.

**Right now, this repo consists solely of category-sorted link indexes, but in the future it will contain direct backups of the content, manually transcribed in Markdown format.**
