*Original description is below:*

A curated collection of content from psionics message boards from the Wayback Machine. Psionics is defined as the use of psychic abilities and energies in a context independent of wider spirituality.

Unlike formal parapsychology, psionics was practiced informally, by people who made money in other hobbies, and who shared information openly, without paywalls, on a somewhat-decentralized network of forums and blogs. 

While the communities of those forums, and the people who ran those blogs, are all gone, they, perhaps unknowingly, left quite a bit behind. This project seeks to organize and preserve those ruins, and build a core layer of documentation so that anyone who wants to can start where they left off.

**Right now, this repo consists solely of category-sorted link indexes, but in the future it will contain direct backups of the content, manually transcribed in Markdown format.**
