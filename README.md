# [The Hazeltine Library](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine)

This repository contains lists of links from various websites and forums from the Online Energy Communities. 
These links go to the Wayback Machine and are organized in a way that can be used by other people to facilitate backups and reformatting of the content.

The OECs were mostly composed around a system called psionics that used ideas from both parapsychology and other spiritual systems. This repository seeks to organize the documentation of that system, as nearly all the websites have gone offline when the communities fell apart.
The original plan was to create a full-text backup and formatted archive of the content directly alongside these links, however I am no longer pursuing this, as I have moved past personal investment in these practices.

These files are **not** comprehensive lists. Some stuff was ignored by me trying to navigate the huge mass of content on the Wayback Machine, and other content was never archived by it to begin with. 
You can look at the Wayback Machine's unfiltered index for any domain by navigating to the "URLs" tab of that domain.

**Inclusion of content in this repository is not an endorsement,** this is intended to give a big enough picture of the ideas of psionics that others can evaluate them on their merits.

## Navigation
This repo is organized into indexes (files) and sections. 
Websites with a lot of content have their own indexes, sites with a smaller amount of important things get put into the [miscellaneous sources index](./index-70-miscellaneous.md).
Sections with names in quotes were organized by their authors to be read in a specific order, and are sorted as they were on their original source. All other sections are organized by category.
Psipog.net is not listed here, as its backup is available in full on both [this GitHub account](https://github.com/libhazeltine/psipog-lhz) and as a [compressed archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20130321035504/http://www.psipog.net/) on the Wayback Machine.
