## Major indexing tasks
 - [psiscape.net](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.psiscape.net/*)
   - 5100+ pages on WebArchive, requires significant time investment.
   -  ✅ Indexed.
 - [shiftedperspectives.net](https://web.archive.org/web/*/shiftedperspectives.net*) 
   - Same situation as psiscape.net
   - ✅ Indexed.
 - [thepsiworld.net](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thepsiworld.net/*)
   - 1600+ pages, so not as? bad
   - ✅ Indexed.
 - psionicsinstitute.org - [Live as of 02/2024](https://www.psionicsinstitute.org/education/articles/), [WebArchive link](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.psionicsinstitute.org*) 
   - Need to figure out how to mix live content with archives.
   - ✅ Indexed, nothing useful.
 - psipalatium.com - [Live as of 02/2024](http://www.psipalatium.com/index.php), [WebArchive link](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.psipalatium.com/*) 
   - Same situation as psionicsinstitute.org
   - ✅ Indexed.
 - [psionicsonline.net](https://web.archive.org/web/*/psionicsonline.net*)
   - Need to reinvestigate. IIRC some of this site was structured in a weird way that I never actually accounted for, so some of it was ignored.
   - [-] In progress, see [the branch](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine/tree/psionicsonline-v2).
 - psipog.net - [Full site backup from closure](https://web.archive.org/web/20130321035504/http://www.psipog.net/), [WebArchive link](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.psipog.net/*)
   - Compressed archive is more comprehensive than webarchives, so I'll have to manually fill in paths to the selfhosted archive.
   - [=] In queue.

## Source-specific notes
### psionicsinstitute.org
Certain sites from the forum sections of `psionicsinstitute.org` and `psionics.net16.net` have some rather weird page layout errors on the Wayback Machine.
If you encounter these issues, you can run the following code in your browser's console to fix it:
```js
document.getElementById("main").style.setProperty('margin-left', '0%');
```
